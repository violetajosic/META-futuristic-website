            <h1>Terms of service</h1>
            <p>We don’t charge you for using META, unless we state otherwise. Instead, businesses and organizations, and
                other persons pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using META, you agree that we
                can show you ads that we think may be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data to
                help determine which personalized ads to show you.

                you (such as your name, email address or other contact information). Instead, advertisers can tell us
                things like the kind of audience they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may be
                interested.
